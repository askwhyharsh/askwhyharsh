# Hi, I'm Harsh! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a **Blockchain Developer** passionate about building decentralized applications, currently doing and learning -  ZK, Rust, Go

---

## ðŸš€ What I've Worked On  

### Professional Experience  
- **[Qiro.fi](https://qiro.fi)** â€“ Wrote Protocol Smart contracts and also worked on the underwriting protocol, that allowed decentralised underwriting onchain using ritual.net . 
- **[Alive.house](https://alive.house)** â€“ Contributed to blockchain and backend infrastructure for a music NFT platform, all the auction types and mints onchain.  
- **[Zefi.io](https://zefi.io)** â€“ Worked on blockchain-based financial tools.  

### Personal Projects  
- **[LinkCollect.io](https://linkcollect.io)**  
  A social bookmarking tool that once had **3,000+ users**, with **400+ active users** currently.  
  - Built to simplify content curation and sharing.  

- **[My Rust Projects](https://github.com/askwhyharsh/my-rust-projects)**  
  Exploring Rust through practical projects.  
  - **Encrypted Credit Score Testing (FHE)**: Experimenting with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).  
  - **[Function Layer AVS](https://github.com/askwhyharsh/function_layer_AVS)**: A Offchain but decentralised actively validated service on EigenLayer that helps with decntralised computation of functions in any language (js/go/py) in decentralised manner, and to be able to call these function from within solidity contracts and use the outputs.
